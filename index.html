				<p>Brightside is a pop/rock band born for radio. They have a live set full of hooks and sing-along choruses with just enough guitar crunch to remind you this ain’t One Direction. Brightside is based out of Tallahassee, FL and wins fans over through relentless DIY club tours and opening for national acts.</p>
				<p>In 2017 they set out to destroy their van, opening for We The Kings and Cute Is What We Aim For on the WTK10 tour (5 Florida dates) and quickly following up with two headlining club runs. They have also done several one-off shows throughout Florida with Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Senses Fail, and more, as well as playing The Vans Warped Tour (Jacksonville) and The Florida Music Festival. Their nice-guy reputation was earned by playing and organizing multiple charity events aimed at helping the needy as well as growing the local music scene by giving new bands the opening slots.</p>
				<p>They hit the ground running in late 2014 with their first EP produced by Lee Dyess (Mayday Parade, From First to Last, Go Radio). The band got back in the studio in 2017 with Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount (Mayday Parade, Cartel, All Time Low) and James Paul Wisner (Dashboard Confessional, Paramore, Further Seems Forever) to cut their sophomore EP “Heart Science” (paid for by fans through a crowdfunding campaign). Lead single "AEIOU" got plenty of spins on Tallahassee's Hot 104.9 FM and the band lit the phones up during their frequent station interviews. Brightside is gaining ground on Spotify making a quick jump from 2k streams to 250k.</p>
				<p>Brightside routinely sells 350-400 tickets in Tallahassee (often delivering them personally) and has been hammering the southeast playing regularly in Atlanta, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Tampa, Orlando, and Fort Lauderdale building their out-of-town draw (100-150) one fan at a time. They are ferocious social media promoters, spending their mornings online poaching fans, making videos, and returning messages with their afternoons spent writing, rehearsing, recording, or stuffed into a van. They’re coming out of their cage and they’ve been doing just fine.</p>
